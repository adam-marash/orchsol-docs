# Getting started with Orchestra Solutions

Orchestra is a payment orchestration platform. With a single API integration, you can route payments across multiple providers worldwide, support regional payment methods, and meet compliance requirements without building separate integrations for each market and provider.

By following this guide, you'll sign up for the Orchestra Solutions sandbox, generate your first API key, and make a successful API call. The goal is to get you started quickly, make sure you can connect to the API, and give you a starting point for exploring and building with Orchestra.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this guide you will be able to:

- **Work in the sandbox environment** after creating your API key
- **Authenticate with Orchestra's APIs**, proving you can connect securely and reliably
- **Send and validate a request**, confirming that the platform responds as expected
- **Choose your next step** by branching into product-specific guides

## How Orchestra fits together

Before we get hands-on, let's understand how the different parts of the Orchestra platform fit together:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <div>
    **Universal Payment Gateway (UPG)**
    The core server-side API for creating charges, refunds, and routing payments across providers.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Payments Library**
    A JavaScript SDK for handling payment buttons and wallet flows in the browser.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Payment Gateway Accounts**
    Secure storage for your (or your customers') merchant credentials, used when routing through the UPG.
  </div>
  <div>
    **Supporting services**
    Tools like String Tokens for vaulting sensitive data and other utilities.
  </div>
</Columns>

## Register for the sandbox

Orchestra provides two environments: **Sandbox** and **Production**.

- **The Sandbox** is where you can learn the API, experiment, and start to build your integration without touching real transactions. Anyone can create an account to work with the Sandbox.
- **Production** is where you'll run production workloads. As with many financial services APIs, you can request access following review from our team.

**Create your account** at [orchestrasolutions.com/sandbox](https://orchestrasolutions.com/sandbox/)

## Generate an API key

After logging into the [developer dashboard](https://portal.epaytools.com/), open the **Settings** menu under your name in the top-right corner. Select **API Keys**.

<Frame>
  ![API Keys menu](/images/api-keys-menu-entry.png)
</Frame>

On the **API Keys** page you can view and manage your existing keys (for example, delete or rotate a key when needed). As you've just registered, the keys list will be empty. Let's create your first Sandbox key.

<Frame>
  ![Create API key](/images/create-api-key.png)
</Frame>

- **Name:** Give the key a descriptive label (for example, `Test key` or `CI/CD pipeline`)
- **Username:** You'll only see your own user account listed. In the future when working in a team, you'll have the option to create keys for other users
- **Assign it to my user:** Check this box to tie the key directly to your user account

Click **Save** to create the key.

A modal will open showing your new API key. **Copy the key right away** as you won't be able to view it again.

## Make your first API call

Now that you have a Sandbox API key, let's use it to verify everything is working.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -s "https://api.epaytools.com/Utils/apiKey" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $ORCHESTRA_API_KEY"
```

```javascript Node.js
const res = await fetch("https://api.epaytools.com/Utils/apiKey", {
  headers: {
    "X-Api-Key": process.env.ORCHESTRA_API_KEY, // replace with your key
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
});

const data = await res.json();
console.log(data);
```
</CodeGroup>

If all goes well, you should see a response like:

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "userName": "sandbox_user@example.com",
  "accountId": 12345,
  "isSandbox": true
}
```

<Warning>
### Troubleshooting

If you use the wrong API key:

- With **cURL**, you may see no output at all (silent `401 Unauthorized`)
- With **JavaScript**, you may see a "JSON parse error" because the response body is empty

In both cases, double-check the `X-Api-Key` header value.
</Warning>

## Next steps

Now you've registered with Orchestra, generated a sandbox API key, and verified your connection to the API.

Before you can make a test payment in the sandbox, you need to:

### 1. Choose how you'll handle payment credentials

- **Processing payments only for your own business?**
  Pass your gateway credentials directly in each UPG request. This is the simplest way to get started.
- **Processing payments on behalf of your customers?**
  Use **Payment Gateway Accounts** to securely vault each customer's merchant credentials once, then reference them in UPG requests. This avoids handling sensitive data in your own systems.

### 2. Handle payment details

Decide how payment data enters your flow:
- Use the **Payments Library** (JavaScript SDK) to collect card and wallet details in the browser
- Or use **String Tokens** to vault card numbers or other sensitive values server-side

### 3. Make a payment with the UPG

With credentials and payment details in place, call the **Universal Payment Gateway (UPG)** to create a sandbox charge, capture funds, or issue a refund.

### 4. Go live in production

When you're ready, request production access, generate a production API key, and swap your sandbox credentials for live ones.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For your own business">
    Skip gateway accounts and go straight to **[Make your first charge](/make-first-charge)**.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For your customers">
    First, **[create a Gateway Account](/gateway-accounts)** to vault your customers' credentials.
    Then continue to **[Make your first charge](/make-first-charge)**.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
